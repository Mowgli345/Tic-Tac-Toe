PracDOMScripts - works okay except for player names being hard coded as globals
PracScripts - doesn't display initial grid
 - when playGame finihses running, loops back and does everything agin, not saving player names
 Script with Player Name s- from PracDomScripts - trying to get playe rnames in. Modified for 3 sqaueare
   - ISSUE - after running getNames, goes back to top and runs all events etc again


Objects
1. Gameboard - stores gameboard array x1
2. Players x2
3. GameFlow x1
4. displayController x1 (?)

Single instances - wrap factory inside IIFE

Each item of functioanlity should fit in the game, player or GameBoard objects


Steps
1. Get a working game in the console
2. Create object to handle display/DOM
 - write function to render contents of gameboard array to webpage
3. Function - allow player to input marker on page (DOM element). 
Function - prevent taking an already taken place

4. Allow to add names, start/restart button, display results

Logic Needed
GameOver - wins and ties


Points
Minimise global code
Use factories where possible
For single instances (Eg. gameboard, displayController) - wrap factory inside IIFE module pattern

Each piece of functionality should fit in game, player or gamebaord objects


Now - GameOver - ties, winner


Object 1 - Game



Object 2 - GameBoard


Object 3 - Player


TO DO
Edit dispalyGrid - use loop to create elements incl. dataset numbers
Player -> to a single Player object
CheckWin - edit for Player 1 and Player 2
Play Again
Reset
Edit names input to different dialogue screens  - maybe using promise....
